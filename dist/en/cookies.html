                        authorized service providers may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels,

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You are encouraged to periodically review this Cookie Policy to stay informed of updates. You

                    <h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3>

                    A “cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identifier that we store on your
                    computer. Your browser then provides that unique identifier to use each time you submit a query to
                    the Site. We use cookies on the Site to, among other things, keep track of services you have used,
                    record registration information, record your user preferences, keep you logged into the Site,
                    facilitate purchase procedures, and track the pages you visit. Cookies help us understand how the
                    Site is being used and improve your user experience.

                    <h3>TYPES OF COOKIES</h3>

                    The following types of cookies may be used when you visit the Site:

                    <ul>
                        <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>

                        <li>
                            Advertising cookies are placed on your computer by advertisers and ad servers in order to
                            display
                            advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to you. These cookies allow
                            advertisers
                            and ad
                            servers to gather information about your visits to the Site and other websites, alternate
                            the
                            ads
                            sent to a specific computer, and track how often an ad has been viewed and by whom. These
                            cookies
                            are linked to a computer and do not gather any personal information about you.

                        </li>

                    <h3>OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h3>

                    <p>
                        In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies on
                        the
                        Site to help customize the Site and improve your experience. A “web beacon” or “pixel tag” is
                        tiny
                        object or image embedded in a web page or email. They are used to track the number of users who
                        have
                        visited particular pages and viewed emails, and acquire other statistical data. They collect
                        only a
                        limited set of data, such as a cookie number, time and date of page or email view, and a
                        description
                        of the page or email on which they reside. Web beacons and pixel tags cannot be declined.
                        However,
                        you can limit their use by controlling the cookies that interact with them.
